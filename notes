How should I display an event in the view?
    The event should be its own view.
    It needs to be clickable

    TODO
    - Remove these hour views and create one long container in row_day.xml
    - The height will eventually be absolute, but we need to CALCULATE IT using the number of days we need to show and the amount of dp the RecyclerView is using.
        - availableSpaceDP is now an input arg for the adapter.
        - Once the height of the day view
        This absolute height represents 24 hours in a day
            Divide height by 1440 to get how may pixels there are in a minute.

        Create the timeAmount view - this shows the time on the right hand side
            Divide this view into minutes - use the 'minutePixels' value found above

        Create another view that sits next to the timeAmount view
            This will be the container for events
            This container should be clickable
                When clicked, a new event should be created.
                The time the event starts should be calculated by where the time intersects
                    If clicked on 13:43, then round to 13:45

        For each event, create a new view that sits in the eventContainer
            The view should be clickable
                The single event page should load

        If there is a second event that runs at the same time as another, then the views have to share the space in the container
