How do we get a notice when the specified CHILD view is added?
	We need a version of OnHierachyViewChanged that only returns when the SPECIFIED CHILD VIEW is added


We want a callback in each of my custom views to give me the chance to do something custom when the view is loaded.
	Perhaps each custom view implements a custom abstract parent view called LifeCycleView ?
	LifeCycleView should have a LISTENER that listens to the ACTIVITY'S OnHierachyViewChange callback





	Does the ACTIVITY need to hold the current child's OnHierachy callback?
	The activity must also LISTEN for the OnHierachy change itself so it can notify the current CHILD
