How do I want to request the Month View with TODAYS DATE from a PRESENTER?
    Well the presenter now has a backstack interface.
    Ideally I want to say backstack.goTo(MONTH_VIEW.key, Date()) (or something)






How do I want to tag each view in the CalendarAdapter?
    By date so that when the user presses on a day, the date can be sent along to the presenter for adding an event to that day.

    Ideally I want a list of DAY objects for the Adapter to take and just show.
    Day has:
        dayOfMonth
        month
        year
